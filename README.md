# Anime Face Generation using GANs

This repository contains code for generating anime faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This project was developed as part of the Computational Creativity module during the Master's degree program in Computer Games at Queen Mary University of London.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework. This project specifically focuses on generating anime faces using GANs.

## Features

- Pre-trained GAN model for generating anime faces
- Training script to train the GAN model on custom datasets
- Script for generating anime faces using the trained GAN model
- Colab Notebook for interactive exploration and generation of anime faces

## 

### Training the GAN model

To train the GAN model on your own dataset, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your dataset of anime faces and place it in the appropriate directory.
2. Set the dataset path and other parameters in the training script.
3. Run the training script to start training the GAN model.

### Generating Anime Faces

You can generate anime faces using the pre-trained GAN model by following these steps:
1. Load the pre-trained weights of the GAN model.
2. Use the provided Colab Notebook to generate anime faces.
